# HeytinGET

Find a counter-model and a valuation for the corresponding heyting poset for a proposition.

## Heyting poset

A Heyting poset (named after the famous mathematician Arend Heyting) is a partially ordered set with the following properties:

```math
max \{ z : z \leq x \space and \space z \leq y \} \\
max \{ z : x \leq z \space and \space y \leq z \} \\
max \{ z : x \land z \leq y \}
```

## Some of its central features:
- Topological semantics.
- Kernel build upon GNU/Bison.
